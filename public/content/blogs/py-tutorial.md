# Python Programming Tutorial: A Comprehensive Guide

Welcome to this Python programming tutorial! Whether you're a beginner or looking to deepen your understanding of Python, this guide covers everything from the basics to advanced concepts.

## Introduction to Python

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and versatility. It is widely used in web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more.

### Why Learn Python?

- **Beginner-Friendly**: Python's syntax is straightforward and easy to learn.
- **Versatile**: Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.
- **Rich Ecosystem**: Python has an extensive library ecosystem, including NumPy, Pandas, and TensorFlow.

## Setting Up Python

Before you start coding, follow these steps to set up Python:

1. **Install Python**: Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. **Choose an IDE/Text Editor**: Use IDEs like PyCharm, Jupyter Notebook, or Visual Studio Code. Alternatively, a simple text editor like Sublime Text works too.
3. **Verify Installation**: Open your terminal and type `python --version` to ensure Python is installed.

## Python Basics

Let’s start with the basics of Python, including variables, control structures, and functions.

### Variables and Data Types

```python
# Declaring variables
name = "Alice"  # String
age = 25        # Integer
is_student = True  # Boolean

print(f"Name: {name}, Age: {age}, Student: {is_student}")
```

### Control Structures

```python
# Conditional Statements and Loops

# If-Else Example
score = 85
if score >= 90:
    print("Grade: A")
elif score >= 80:
    print("Grade: B")
else:
    print("Grade: C")

# For Loop Example
for i in range(5):
    print(f"Iteration {i}")

# While Loop Example
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(f"Count: {count}")
    count += 1
```

### Functions
```python 
# Function Example
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("Alice"))

# Lambda Function Example
add = lambda a, b: a + b
print(add(3, 5))
```

## Intermediate Python

Once you’re comfortable with the basics, explore intermediate topics like object-oriented programming, file handling, and modules.

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

```py
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        self.name = name
        self.breed = breed

    def bark(self):
        print(f"{self.name} says Woof!")

# Using the class
dog = Dog("Buddy", "Golden Retriever")
dog.bark()
```

### File Handling
```py
# Writing and Reading a File

# Writing to a file
with open("example.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, world!")

# Reading from a file
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
```

### Modules

```py
# Using Built-in Modules

import math
print(math.sqrt(16))

# Using External Modules
import requests
response = requests.get("https://api.github.com")
print(response.status_code)
```

## Advanced Python

Dive into advanced topics like decorators, generators, and error handling.

### Decorators

```py 
def decorator_function(original_function):
    def wrapper_function():
        print("Wrapper executed before", original_function.__name__)
        return original_function()
    return wrapper_function

@decorator_function
def display():
    print("Display function executed")

display()
```

### Generators

```py
def generate_numbers(n):
    for i in range(n):
        yield i

for number in generate_numbers(5):
    print(number)
```

### Exception Handling

```py
try:
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
    print("Error:", e)
finally:
    print("Execution completed.")
```

# Conclusion

- Congratulations on completing this Python tutorial! You've learned the basics, intermediate concepts, and even advanced topics. Python is a powerful and versatile language, and with continued practice, you can tackle a wide range of programming challenges.

***Happy coding!***
